				<p>As an artist I asked myself the same question. How often am I on the internet, phone, or computer? How about in comparison to how often I'm creating something? Finally taking a step back, a breath, to actually think about my consumption habits alarmed me. Hours would disappear, while nothing in my tangible world changed. I would get so lost in swipes and clicks that I would use it to cope with stress, when in reality the procrastination was creating even more stress as my deadlines creeped towards me. I had to make a change or at least find a way to turn my consumption into creation.  </p>

				<p>The way we attempt to recreate our personalities in a digital space through social media has led to a very interesting phenomenon. We are becoming consumable and self promoting. Before the digital age publishing was difficult. Only the most interesting and constructive humans were considered for consumption. Now, the ability to create and publish to the world is at our fingertips, no censors. Fame has transformed from glamourous, impossible, and earned ...into possible. With that, the definition of fame changes. Fame now relates to a quantafiable value, the amount of likes, or followers somebody obtains.  </p>

        <p>Using screen captures I relive my consumption while turning it into a creation. I recreate myself in digital form, the time I spend, the things I do, the things that influence me. I've found a way to turn my consumption habits and the hilarity of wasted time into something consumable.

				<p>Appropriating the frames and design of the OSX and iOS operating systems, and social media platforms into my work I wonder if people even notice them. Considering everything we consume or create on the computer lies within these pre-created bounds and frames. I hope they feel either interactive or go unconsidered. </p>

				<p>Recently, I've been inspired by Vaporwave and other aesthetic based subcultures. Vaporwave really pokes fun at capitalist ideals while being ironically capitalist. Maybe it's not as ironic as it is unescapable, but the communities that embrace this fact have interesting ways of dealing with these issues. The art these communities create pokes fun at the early digital age. Often referencing the 3D graphics of the 80's, marble statues, and Fiji Water. It's aesthetic over function. Vaporwave is actually a play on the term "Vaporware", products or software that gets advertised but never made.   </p>

				<p>As my ideas progressed I thought about what it would be like to be immersed into my digital "self portrait", I thought about a 360 degree version of my screen captures. With the 360 video technology today I can create that virtural space. The idea of surrounding my viewer within a space created out of my consumption and creations is both exciting and intimidating. Windows will pop up and disappear all around them, they'll get to explore the area and have more of a choice in what they'll be viewing. I want to finally open the project up to people willing to send me their consumption in the form of screen captures. </p>

        <p> The final project will be on display at International Center Of Photography in New York City, along with a take-away in the form of a custom designed cardboard VR viewer (limited). July-August 2016.
